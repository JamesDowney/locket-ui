# locket-ui
A relay override for the combat lover's locket in Kingdom of Loathing

### Getting started
`svn checkout https://github.com/Loathing-Associates-Scripting-Society/locket-ui/tree/main/KoLmafia`

### Customization
```
Can I customize the monster displayed
```
Yes! Just add `locket_relay_monsters_custom.json` in KoL Mafia's data directory. I would suggest copying `locket_relay_monsters.json` and modifying it.
```
I'm not a fan of orange. Can I change that?
```
No. Go Tigers.
